# OVO
Officers versus Outlaws

# Overview
This is an NFT Collection and a corellated site. When you mint you can either be an officer or an outlaw. You cannot hold both in the same wallet. There will be more detailed mint logic and constraints outlined below. 

In the site there is a set of gaming features that pit the 2 factions against one another. 

You earn $LOOT when you visit and sign with you wallet (that holds the NFT).  You can hold it yourself, or add it your factions vault for a bonus.  

But your faction's vault is at risk of attack by the other faction. 

If the number of outlaws checked in for the day is more than 25% (or vice versa) an attack can begin. 

An attacks is series of rudimentary tasks like. a word-jumble or trivia question or whatever. (OR WHATEVER) 

1 attack = 10 hit points.  200 points -> 20 $Loot stolen from your oponents vault into yours.
